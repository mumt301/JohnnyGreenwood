<div class="text">
<p>

                
                Best-known as 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
's innovative jack of all trades -- a multi-instrumentalist equally comfortable playing guitar, xylophone, sampler, or keyboards -- 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Jonny Greenwood</a>
also pursued a solo career as a composer while helping his band push the boundaries of its music into unusual and decidedly non-rock directions.                
</p>
<p>

<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Greenwood" class="name-link">Jonathan Richard Guy Greenwood</a>
was born on November 5, 1971, in Oxford, England. Along with his brother 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Greenwood" class="name-link">Colin</a>
, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Greenwood" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
attended Abingdon School near Oxford; it was here that the older 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Greenwood" class="name-link">Colin</a>
first came into contact with schoolmate 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke" class="name-link">Thom Yorke</a>
. Before long, the two were playing music together in a project dubbed TNT. Guitarist 
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_O%27Brien" class="name-link">Ed O'Brien</a>
and drummer 
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Selway" class="name-link">Phil Selway</a>
were soon admitted into the fold, and the new band adopted the moniker 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/09jX2SMWvcFPs2e2YjqwGL?si=02rZTHbwSDuR_URzU5SI-w" class="name-link">On a Friday</a>
(in reference to the day of the week they would routinely get together and practice). 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Jonny Greenwood</a>
, who was a couple of years younger than the other four, repeatedly asked to play with the group; he was finally invited to play harmonica with 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/09jX2SMWvcFPs2e2YjqwGL?si=02rZTHbwSDuR_URzU5SI-w" class="name-link">On a Friday</a>
at a 1987 gig at the Jericho Tavern in Oxford. This proved to be his initiation into the band; he later took over keyboard duties for the group before finally switching into the role of lead guitarist.                
</p>
<p>

                
                However, 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/09jX2SMWvcFPs2e2YjqwGL?si=02rZTHbwSDuR_URzU5SI-w" class="name-link">On a Friday</a>
were placed on an extended hiatus when the four older members went off to college in the fall of 1987. A couple of years later, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
himself went on to study music at Oxford. By the summer of 1991, though, his bandmates had graduated from college and reunited the group, prompting him to leave school (after only a year) so that he could commit to 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/09jX2SMWvcFPs2e2YjqwGL?si=02rZTHbwSDuR_URzU5SI-w" class="name-link">On a Friday</a>
on a full-time basis.                
</p>
<p>

                
                The re-formed quintet quickly got to work, recording and releasing a series of demo tapes and gigging steadily in the area. It wasn't long before the major labels came knocking, and 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/09jX2SMWvcFPs2e2YjqwGL?si=02rZTHbwSDuR_URzU5SI-w" class="name-link">On a Friday</a>
soon had a record deal with EMI. Their new label quickly pointed out (not unjustly) that the band's name was somewhat unwieldy; the group concurred, and 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
was selected as the new name, taken from the title of a 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2x9SpqnPi8rlE9pjHBwmSC?si=WxSxCmIKT5auuJ5WvGjGeA" class="name-link">Talking Heads</a>
song.                
</p>
<p>

<p>
            
            In late 1992, 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
exploded in America with their single "Creep"; featuring 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
's jarringly percussive, muted guitar bursts (which strangely provided the song's hook), "Creep" was widely embraced by MTV and alternative radio, which put the song into heavy rotation. Although follow-up singles from their album 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6400dnyeDyD2mIFHfkwHXN?si=LZkUxycNQX2J7EaCaV9KNg" class="album-link">Pablo Honey</a>
were released, 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
could not escape the one-hit wonder stigma until the release of 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/500FEaUzn8lN9zWFyZG5C2?si=dGgYFIOvTDqLjeJMvZ9hKw" class="album-link">The Bends</a>
in 1995. An amazing artistic leap over their first album, 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/500FEaUzn8lN9zWFyZG5C2?si=dGgYFIOvTDqLjeJMvZ9hKw" class="album-link">The Bends</a>
contained plenty of 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Jonny Greenwood</a>
guitar pyrotechnics ("Just," "My Iron Lung"), but also revealed an assured, mature side of the group that was previously unknown ("Street Spirit," "Fake Plastic Trees").  

</p>
<p>

                
                Around this time, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
's physically aggressive style of playing guitar began to take a toll on his right wrist. To relieve the pain and deter the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome, he was fitted with a wrist brace to provide support to the joint. The brace soon became a trademark of sorts for 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
, and he continued to wear it out of routine long after the immediate threat of injury was gone.                
</p>
<p>

                
                After 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/500FEaUzn8lN9zWFyZG5C2?si=dGgYFIOvTDqLjeJMvZ9hKw" class="album-link">The Bends</a>
, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
began to show signs that he was growing uninspired with using the guitar as his primary means of expression. Said the guitarist, "There's only 12 power chords, and I think we've had about 20 years of them, so maybe it's time to move on." 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
took this sentiment so far as to (half-jokingly) issue a prompt to online 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
fans, asking them to send him any interesting chord progressions that they could devise.                
</p>
<p>


<p>           
            Nevertheless, when 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
released the massively successful 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7dxKtc08dYeRVHt3p9CZJn?si=mXtwqIuQRKGulYzHG1u3oA" class="album-link">OK Computer</a>
in 1997, the guitar work was taken to new heights. Beginning immediately with the opening atonal "Airbag" riff, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
redefined what a guitar could sound like, whether it was the distant, chiming gull cries of "Subterranean Homesick Alien" (which succeeds admirably in its attempt to re-create 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0kbYTNQb4Pb1rPbbaF0pT4?si=gf3C0XJSTKuwC5yJGO9m1Q" class="name-link">Miles Davis</a>
' 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3Q0zkOZEOC855ErOOJ1AdO?si=M48symhVRO6YBvBmSuDppw" class="album-link">Bitches Brew</a>
trumpet tone) or the digital meltdown near the end of "Paranoid Android."                </p>
<p>


<p>        
            On the ensuing North American tour, however, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
's dissatisfaction with playing strictly guitar-oriented music reached its zenith -- a feeling that was carried over into the recording studio following the tour's completion. The release of 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/19RUXBFyM4PpmrLRdtqWbp?si=THHPmRw_S4C4_RBbiUZCHQ" class="album-link">Kid A</a>
in 2000 and its counterpart, 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6V9YnBmFjWmXCBaUVRCVXP?si=Trm0gxmbScuCH6EEGShDuA" class="album-link">Amnesiac</a>
, the following year clearly reflected this; 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
's trademark guitars had vanished from all but a handful of their songs, replaced instead with layers of synthesizers, keyboards, and samplers. And although 
<a href="Radiohead_Discography.html" class="name-link">Radiohead</a>
's 2003 release, 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1oW3v5Har9mvXnGk0x4fHm?si=pLcPaOINSdivIBo680m_KQ" class="album-link">Hail to the Thief</a>
, featured more guitars than either of the group's previous two albums, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Jonny Greenwood</a>
's debut solo album, 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1j32YNHecGYjHkURAfgZb7?si=QxkZSsptRr-Sli-PjPXN9g" class="album-link">Bodysong</a>
(released later that year), was a mostly guitarless affair, proving once again that 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
need not be shackled to the confines of the electric guitar to compose original, evocative music.                 </p>


<p>          
            He was hired by the BBC as composer in residence the following year, resulting in the publication of a handful of pieces, including "smear," "Piano for Children," and "Popcorn Superhet Receiver." 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3L1BuUrd1OyiN83CXXWO3x?si=h98jqZRgR_6ojUpQMDrr9g" class="album-link">Jonny Greenwood Is the Controller</a>
, a compilation of reggae and dub tracks from the vaults of Trojan Records, was released in 2007, as was his critically acclaimed soundtrack for director 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson" class="name-link">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>
's Academy Award-winning oil tycoon drama 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0K7xCNs6QjWl1B2mPKCnk3?si=jWeCy_9zTfaaKE73cnEhxQ" class="album-link">There Will Be Blood</a>
, which featured excerpts of "Popcorn Superhet Receiver"; because it included pre-existing music, it was deemed ineligible for an Academy Award nomination.                 </p>


<p>        
            His work in film continued in 2010 with the soundtrack for Tran Anh Hung's big-screen adaptation of Japanese author 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami" class="name-link">Haruki Murakami</a>
's 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1deQZwfO0XETbsj9dStdeT?si=Q4bsvwThQ56RnZ20NzvrAw" class="album-link">Norwegian Wood</a>
. The following year, his score for We Need to Talk About Kevin, a film adaptation of Lionel Shriver's novel, arrived; in 2012, he reunited with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson" class="name-link">Anderson</a>
for the score to 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3Ggrc0BQZDRuxdwtvXYWkZ?si=A4PCAGN1QbqEILle2_UdLw" class="album-link">The Master</a>
. That year, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
also worked with one of his biggest inspirations, 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0qEO82Hj3SvjoNyEfKpRku?si=FYuTHQgqSou5qFcY4dca5Q" class="name-link">Krzysztof Penderecki</a>
; their collaboration, which included 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
's homage to the composer, "48 Responses to Polymorphia," arrived that March. 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2b2fMkaLHpGD5iABOwhL3j?si=93iL5K2gQq6lq9JVsdeu_A" class="name-link">The Australian Chamber Orchestra</a>
commissioned 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
to compose the piece Water, which premiered in 2014 during a three-month residency in Sydney. Late that year, his score to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson" class="name-link">Anderson</a>
's adaptation of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon" class="name-link">Thomas Pynchon</a>
novel 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3LIMxY8oQG9c70DWKe0iHN?si=WOJk5qwxTI20RvbIBI_tww" class="album-link">Inherent Vice</a>
arrived.                 </p>


<p>        
            In 2015, 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
traveled to the Mehrangarh Fort in the state of Rajasthan, India, and collaborated with Israeli composer 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2UCzkuXiE37VD7K123J4Tf?si=zBOTFOp8QHW5mavGAlBFuw" class="name-link">Shye Ben Tzur</a>

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0g7gHEXKEHU4snTwOZSxNO?si=KCvUbNsYT-O4irqceaVFxw" class="name-link">Nigel Godrich</a>
. The recording session was documented by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson" class="name-link">Anderson</a>
and released as a film titled 
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/34hrDcvF6cVfSKS70c25Xn?si=c5-7MLJTTpGSUVFeGsCRuA" class="album-link">Junun</a>
, and an album of the same name was released by Nonesuch that November. After working on string orchestrations for

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5WyVg6gJ9kCPkZs4zhIrDz?si=78LvoOobQlSv51IsPHkFVA" class="album-link">Phantom Thread</a>
, which incorporated a 60-piece orchestra and drew inspiration from

's string arrangements. That year, he scored the

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5WyVg6gJ9kCPkZs4zhIrDz?si=78LvoOobQlSv51IsPHkFVA" class="album-link">Phantom Thread</a>
also landed 
<a href="Film Scoring.html" class="name-link">Greenwood</a>
his first nomination for Best Original Score at the 90th Academy Awards in 2018. The following year, he started his own classical music label, Octatonic Records.
